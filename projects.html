The Semantic Descriptor algorithm makes better decisions the more data you give it. Instead of giving it a small paragraph, we are feed it massive novels in the form
                of text files. The more we give it, the smarter it will be. We will also trim off what are known as "stop words", which are short, common words like "the" that show up in nearly every sentence and will make the descriptors less accurate
                by diluting the relative magnitude of the more unique words. it can detect similarity when given multiple words.FLTK library has been used along with other graphics libraries to create the gui interface for this algorithm. it also gives
                success or failure messages depending on the operation.

                tool using the Huffman algorithm. The project aims to reduce the storage size of files without losing any information <br> <b>Details:</b>The project involves creating two programs: compress and uncompress. The compress program takes an
                arbitrary file as input, creates a Huffman code for the contents of the file, and uses the Huffman code to encode the file. The compressed version of the file is then written to a new file with a header to allow for uncompression. The
                uncompress program takes a compressed file created by the compress program as input, reads the header of the file to construct a Huffman code, uses the Huffman code to decode the compressed file, and writes the uncompressed version of
                the file to a new file.

                Adafruit. The taillights automatically adjust their brightness depending on the ambient light, and can also be controlled to act as turn signals or brake lights.To use the turn signals, press and hold button A for the left turn signal
                or button B for the right turn signal. The corresponding taillights will flash red in increments of 0.35 seconds. To use the brake lights, the sensor should be triggered by the brake string when the rider pulls the brake levers. This will
                turn on the red lights to signal that the rider is braking. To activate the hazard signal, toggle button B. The taillights will flash red and orange alternately with a delay of 0.35 seconds between each flash.
